# PaintAR (Formerly ProjectAR)

PaintAR is an iOS augmented reality application which allows users to embed virtual models of interior decorative items (paintings) into real space. The application leverages ARKit and SceneKit to create an immersive augmented reality experience. 

## Introduction
This mobile application was built as a tool to supplement consumer decisions and to improve consumer satisfaction. Consider the use case of when contemplating a prospective decorative purchase -- the physical consumption and relationship it has with the surrounding environment could have a major impact. Having the ability to preview the item without buying it has been successful business model for many companies which produce glasses, clothing, etc. 

Other solutions existed, albeit crude. As a learning opportunity this application was built.
