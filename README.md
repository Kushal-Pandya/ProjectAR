# PaintAR
PaintAR (ProjectAR) is an iOS augmented reality application which allows users to embed virtual models of interior decorative items (paintings) into real space. The application leverages ARKit and SceneKit to create an immersive augmented reality experience. 

## Introduction
This mobile application was built as a tool to supplement consumer decisions and to improve consumer satisfaction. Consider the use case of when contemplating a prospective decorative purchase -- the physical consumption and relationship it has with the surrounding environment could have a major impact. Having the ability to preview the item without buying it has been successful business model for many companies which produce glasses, clothing, etc. 

Other solutions existed, albeit crude. The goals of the project was technological exploration and to serve as a learning opportunity. The application uses ARKit 1.5 and we were faced with known challenges to augmented reality technology, such as lack of data to make sense from.
